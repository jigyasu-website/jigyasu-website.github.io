### Fixed Asset

* Old Way : Capture cost of acquiring net the accounting depreciation.
* New Way : Re-calculate fair market value

### Financial Assets

* Financial assets can take the form of holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.

### Intangible Assets

* Goodwill is the main intangible asset (others are brand name, license etc)
  * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an acquisition.
  * When that acquisition occurs, goodwill is measured as the difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target companyâ€™s asset  value (dressed up book value).
  * It shows up as an asset because without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.



### Current Liabilities

* It can be broken into three groups
  * Non-interest-bearing liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations. 
  
  * Interest-bearing short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
  
  * Deferred salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term
  
    

### Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

* Corporate bonds, represent debt raised from public markets
* Bank loans, debt raised from banks and other lending institiutions
* Lease debt, arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified, but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.
* **Capital Lease**:

  - Treated as if the lessee owns the asset. Eg leasing a delivery truck.
  - Asset and liability recorded on the balance sheet.
  - Depreciation of the leased asset and interest expense.
  - Ownership often transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term.

  **Operating Lease**:

  - Lessee does not assume ownership of the asset. Eg Rental space
  - Asset and liability not recorded on the balance sheet (under traditional rules).
  - Lease payments treated as operating expenses.
  - No depreciation of the leased asset.



### Shareholder Equity

* Shareholder equity, also known as shareholders' equity or owner's  equity, is a key financial metric that represents the residual interest  in the assets of a company after deducting its liabilities. It is a  crucial component of a company's balance sheet and provides valuable  insights into the financial health and ownership structure of the  company.

* **Equation**: Shareholder equity is calculated using the following equation: Shareholder Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

* **Components**: Shareholder equity typically consists of several components, including:

  a. **Common Stock**: The total value of shares issued to common shareholders, often at a nominal par value.

  b. **Preferred Stock**: The total value of shares issued to preferred shareholders, if applicable.

  c. **Retained Earnings**: The cumulative net earnings (profits) of the company that have been retained and not distributed as dividends to shareholders.

  d. **Additional Paid-in Capital**: The amount received from issuing shares above their par value, known as "capital surplus."

  e. **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income**: This includes gains or losses that are not included in the income statement but are recognized directly in equity, such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities.

* **Significance**: Shareholder equity represents the book  value of the company from the perspective of its owners (shareholders).  It shows how much of the company's assets belong to shareholders after  all obligations (liabilities) are settled.



*  Par value, also known as face value or nominal value, is a nominal  dollar amount assigned to each share of stock when a company is  incorporated. It is historically captured, but no real significance in terms of understanding Balance sheet or Company valuation, hence it can be ignored for all practical purpose. 
  * **Market Price vs. Par Value**: The market price of a  company's shares is determined by supply and demand in the stock market  and may be significantly higher than the par value. In fact, many  companies set a par value at a nominal amount and do not reflect the  actual market value of their shares.
  * **Shareholder Equity**: Par value is a component of the  company's shareholders' equity on the balance sheet. It is typically  listed as part of the "Common Stock" or "Preferred Stock" line item.
* Buybacks : Share buybacks, also known as share repurchases, can impact shareholder  equity in several ways, depending on how they are executed and financed. Share buybacks are when a company purchases its own outstanding shares  from the open market or directly from shareholders. Here are the main  ways share buybacks can affect shareholder equity:
  * **Reduced Outstanding Shares**: Buybacks decrease the number of shares in the market, increasing metrics like earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS).
  * **Impact on Retained Earnings**: Funding buybacks from retained earnings reduces this portion of shareholder equity. The source of funding (retained earnings, debt, or cash reserves) determines the overall impact.
  * **Market Perception**: Positive reactions to buybacks can lead to higher stock prices, indirectly benefiting shareholders.
  * **Dividend Alternative**: Buybacks can replace dividend payments, potentially increasing capital appreciation for shareholders as stock prices rise.
