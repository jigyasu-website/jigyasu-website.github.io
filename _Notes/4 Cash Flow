### Goal of Cash Flow

* How much the cash balance of a business changed during a period and why it changed. 
* How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)
* How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business
* How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors

#### Depreciation and amortization (and other non-cash expenses) are added back to cash flow calculations because they are non-cash expenses. Here's why:

1. Non-Cash Expenses: Depreciation and amortization don't involve actual cash outflows; they allocate asset costs over time.
2. Maintaining Accuracy: When calculating cash flow, it's important to  reflect the actual cash movements in and out of a business. Excluding  non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization helps maintain the  accuracy of cash flow statements.
3. Cash Generation: Adding them back shows a company's cash-generating capacity after adjusting for non-cash charges.
4. Decision-Making: Investors and analysts use cash flow to assess a company's financial health and ability to meet obligations, so excluding non-cash expenses provides a clearer picture.



#### Adding back account receivable

* When accounts receivable increase on the balance sheet, it  represents revenue that has been recognized but not yet collected in  cash. To reflect the actual cash generated by a business's operations,  this non-cash portion of revenue is added back to the net income on the  cash flow statement.
* Sometimes, businesses recognize revenue (income) before they actually receive the cash.
* Accounts receivable represents this "unreceived cash."
* To make the cash flow statement accurate, we add back accounts receivable to show only the cash part.
* It helps us see the real cash the business generates or uses.



#### Cash Working Capital vs Non-cash working capital

* Cash flow calculations include two types of working capital changes:
  1. Cash Working Capital: It involves changes in actual cash and cash equivalents.
  2. Non-Cash Working Capital: This considers changes in non-cash items like accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.
* Both types of working capital changes are important in determining how a business's cash flow is affected by its operations. They help provide a complete picture of cash movements.
* To the extent that non-cash working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for any given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.
