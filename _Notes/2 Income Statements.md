## Measuring Income : Accrual vs Cash Accounting

* Accrual Accounting : Where you record transaction when they occur, rather than when cash flows occur
  * Revenues are recorded when the product is sold and NOT when the cash is received.
  * Expenses are recorded with the expenses associated with the producing the sold product or services shown in the period. Even though the money might be spent in prior period, or will be paid in the future.
* Cash Accounting: You record revenue when you get the cash and expenses when you pay

**Unless you've small business, you'll have to use accrual accounting**.

## Type of Expenses

### 1. Operating Expenses (OPEX):

* OPEX refers to the day-to-day expenses incurred by a business to maintain its ongoing operations and generate revenue.
* These expenses are typically short-term in nature and are incurred regularly as part of the company's normal business activities.
* Examples of OPEX include rent, utilities, employee salaries, office supplies, marketing expenses, insurance premiums, and maintenance costs.
* OPEX is fully deductible from the company's revenue in the year it is incurred for tax purposes, reducing taxable income.

### 2. Capital Expenses (CAPEX)

* CAPEX, on the other hand, represents investments made by a business in assets or items that are expected to provide benefits over an extended period, typically beyond one year.
* These expenses are related to the acquisition, improvement, or expansion of long-term assets that will be used to generate revenue or improve the efficiency of the business.
* Examples of CAPEX include purchasing machinery, buying real estate, constructing a new building, upgrading computer systems, and investing in vehicles for the company's fleet.
* Unlike OPEX, CAPEX is not fully deductible in the year of purchase for tax purposes. Instead, it is typically capitalized on the company's balance sheet and then depreciated or amortized over the useful life of the asset. The depreciation or amortization expense is then deducted from taxable income over several years.

### 3. Financing Expenses: 

* They are expenses associated with the use of non-equity financing. Most often, this takes the form of interest expenses on debt.

## Operating Expenses : Breakdown

### 1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

* These are the expenses which are directly related to producing the goods or services that give rise to revenue
* These are netted out from revenues to get to **gross profit**

### 2. Selling, General and Administrative Cost (SG&A)

* Selling expenses - Sales, Marketing, Advertising and Distribution
  *  Examples of selling expenses include sales commissions, advertising and promotional expenses, travel and entertainment costs for sales  representatives, and costs related to sales offices and showrooms.
* General Expenses: General expenses encompass a wide range of costs that  are necessary for the overall functioning of the company but are not  directly tied to production or sales. 
  * This category includes items such  as rent for office space, utilities, office supplies, legal and  accounting fees, insurance premiums, and office equipment expenses.  Essentially, general expenses cover the administrative and operational  costs of running the business.
* Administrative Expenses: Administrative expenses are specific to the  management and administration of a company. 
  * They include salaries and  benefits for executive and administrative staff, office rent and  utilities for administrative offices, office equipment maintenance, and  other costs associated with the management and oversight of the  organization.



1. - ```
     Example: Salary in Software Company
     
     The classification of salaries for engineers in a software company as either Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses depends on the specific role and the nature of their work within the company.
     
     1. COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):
        - In a software company, salaries for engineers involved directly in the development, production, or delivery of software products or services can be considered a part of COGS.
        - This includes software developers, programmers, QA (Quality Assurance) engineers, and other personnel whose work is directly tied to the creation of the company's core software products.
        - Salaries in the COGS category are considered variable costs directly associated with the production of goods or services.
     2. SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative):
        - Salaries for engineers who are not directly involved in the development of software but perform roles related to sales, marketing, administration, or other general support functions are typically classified as SG&A expenses.
        - This includes sales engineers, marketing analysts, administrative staff, and other employees whose work supports the company's overall operations but is not directly tied to product development.

### 3. Depreciation 

* Economic Depreciation : Loss in value of asset as it ages. Ignore in context of Income statements.
* Accounting Depreciation : More mechanical, driven largely by the aging of an asset. Eg Straight line depreciation,  Declining Balance Depreciation, Unit-of-Production Depreciation
* Tax Depreciation : Reflects what the tax authorities will allow as depreciation for purpose of computing taxable income.



### Income from non-operating investments

* Cash & Marketable Securities: Income earned on cash holdings (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses

* Cross Holding in other companies

  * Minority Holding : Income from that holding will usually be reported in the income statement

  * Majority Holding :  if you hold a majority stake of another company, you will generally have to consolidate your financials. That will require you to count 100% of the subsidiaryâ€™s revenues,  operating expenses and operating income as your own. This process is known as "consolidation accounting" or "consolidated financial statements.

    

### Extraordinary Income / Expenses

- Unusual gains or losses reported separately on the income statement.
- Extraordinary income: Gains from rare events like asset sales, insurance settlements, or debt forgiveness.
- Extraordinary expenses: Significant and rare costs, like losses from disasters, legal expenses, or debt restructuring.
- Purpose: To highlight non-recurring events for transparency.
- Reported separately to show core operating performance.
- Helps investors focus on a company's regular financial health.
